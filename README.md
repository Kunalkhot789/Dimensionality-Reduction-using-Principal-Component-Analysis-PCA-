# Dimensionality-Reduction-using-Principal-Component-Analysis-PCA-
📖 Overview
This project demonstrates the use of Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce the dimensionality of high-dimensional datasets while retaining maximum variance. PCA helps simplify data, reduce redundancy, and improve interpretability for analysis and machine learning tasks.

🔍 What This Project Covers
Data loading and basic exploratory data analysis
Feature scaling using StandardScaler
Application of PCA for dimensionality reduction
Analysis of explained variance to select optimal components
Visualization of data in reduced dimensions

🛠️ Tech Stack
Python
Pandas, NumPy
Scikit-learn
Matplotlib, Seaborn

🎯 Outcome
Successfully reduced the number of features while preserving key information, making the dataset easier to analyze and suitable for downstream machine learning models.
